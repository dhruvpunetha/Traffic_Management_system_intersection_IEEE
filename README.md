# Traffic_Management_system_intersection_IEEE
building a traffic management system that will utilize machine learning to control traffic lights at a intersection for the most efficient traffic management

SmallerCodes Folder has all the minor codes that i tried before integrating them to final model .
 for example how to take images from camera in a interval etc

also you need to specify the location of coco.names and yolov3.weight and yolov3.cfg file on your system.

As for the final model model it can run by just cloning it to your system. as it contains all the files needed to run the code.
For the smaller codes you will need to specify the path of yolo config file , coco.names and weights file location in your system
